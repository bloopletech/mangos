Mangos indexes a collection in this format, and generates a HTML/JS Single Page Application (SPA) that allows you to browse and view manga/comics in your collection. The SPA UI is much easier to use than using a filesystem browser or normal image viewer; and the SPA, along with the collection can be trivially served over a network by putting the collection and the SPA in a directory served by nginx or Apache."
